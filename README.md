Forking [This idea](https://github.com/devoteam-g-cloud/Office-Desk-Booking-with-Apps-Script) i made up some changes to suits my needs.

[Here you can find the deployed version](https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbwSvhM9g1iGiJA_ozVQVs1sqNn5T-c_uaqBscTA7mm_umguTXkzdr1FnAbJeW9JAlsygw/exec) so you can see how it works. Basically I extended devoteam's idea with the possibility to book( a seat, a desk or whatever you want ) until max jauge capacity for day. Maybe this is not the most elegant solution written in js but i'm not a js developer ( this is more or less a case study, diving deep javascript).
I've made some changes in html to look more cooler!
