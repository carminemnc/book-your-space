# Office desk Booking Application

Forking [This idea](https://github.com/devoteam-g-cloud/Office-Desk-Booking-with-Apps-Script) i made up some changes to fit my needs.

[Here you can find the deployed version](https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbw8JM3ffqiDej4DKFgWGf3dlwXquI-dHq9cJfYCvZOHAj2GUkaZ9OLv92k4yiEZjV4lbw/exec) so you can see how it works. Basically I extended devoteam's idea with the possibility to book( a seat, a desk or whatever you want ) until max jauge capacity. Maybe this is not the most elegant solution written in js but i'm not a js developer ( this is more or less a case study, diving deep javascript).
I've made some changes in html to look more cooler!


[Here you can find the script](https://script.google.com/home/projects/1liA2JnkF1mC53L19v2ZvX25FHYAGa8dPpl2esbygBhzUGwqJshZDYthb) you can take a free copy of this.
